# Discord Bot written in Go.

This is a simple discord bot written in Go, which has a couple of functionalities right now.

1. On messaging "ping" in the channel, the bot replies with "pong".
2. When a person comes online in the server, the bot greets them with a "Hi Welcome." message in their DM.

More functionalities will be added later.
